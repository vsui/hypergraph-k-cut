# hexperiment

This is a tool for generating benchmark data for the various hypergraph cut algorithms.

Generally, this tool will generate families of hypergraphs and run cut algorithms on each hypergraph instance.
At the end of the run the tool will output information on the runs into an output folder.

## Usage

```hexperiment <config> <dest>```

`<config>` is a path to a YAML file for the configuration of the experiment.
For examples of valid config files see the [`configs` directory](configs).

`dest` is a path to an output directory for the artifacts generated by a run of `hexperiment`.
`hexperiment` generates the following artifacts:
- `data.db`: a SQLite database containing individual runs of the algorithm as well as hypergraphs and cuts
- `data.csv`: A CSV file containing averages for the run times of each algorithm on each hypergraph
- `log.txt`: A log of the experiment
- Various plots
